The IMP-act challenge is a competition to accelerate the development of algorithms 
for inspection and maintenance planning (IMP) of deteriorating engineering systems, such as bridges, aircraft, wind farms, etc. In this competition, we focus on inspection and maintenance planning of road networks in Europe. 

```{admonition} **Goal**
