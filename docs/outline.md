- What is the problem and itsÂ significance?

- Challenges
    - Cooperation
    - Scalability
    - Partial Observability
    - Stochastic Deterioration

# Challenge

## General

## Rules & Prizes

## Submission


# Getting Started

## Installation

- Outline common ways to install package
- Split into two parts, installing environment and user packages. This helps isolate issues, and ensuring that user can atlest install the environment without conflicts.
- Provide a test script that checks installtion

## Quickstart
- Load the toy environment and show a rollout with a basic policy.
- Basic post-processing: visualisation, summary statistics

# Tutorials
- Train QMIX agent with EpyMARL
- Implement a heuristic
- JAX wrapper?

# Environment

## Concept

(Dec-POMDP definition)
- State Space
- Action Space
- Transition model
- Reward model
- Observation model
- Time horizon
- Objective function

#### Objective function
